Insurance for packages lost in the warehouse or lost during the shipping covers  only the value entered in the customs declaration. You have to be able to prove  value entered by invoice or order. If you claim lower value in customs  declaration that is what you get paid. You have to support insurance claims for  lost or damaged items with a proof that those items were really received at our  warehouse and were in good condition. The best way is to let us take content  photos of your incoming packages or use special request to inspect content. See  how to avoid problems.</p>

We will cover the  cost of shipping and handling, but we will not compensate for delays or  inconvenience.
