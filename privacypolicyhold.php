We therefore have no responsibility  or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless,  we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about  these sites.</p>
<p>Google</p>
<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by  Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive  experience for users.  https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en </p>
<p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>
<p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads  on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our  users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.  Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and  Content Network privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have implemented the following:</p>
<p>      • Remarketing  with Google AdSense</p>

  Users can set  preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page.  Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative  Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.<br>
  California Online Privacy Protection Act<br>
  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require  commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's  reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the  United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting  Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a  conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being  collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -  See more at:  http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
  Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to  it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after  entering our website.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can  easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
<p>      • On our Privacy  Policy Page</p>
<p>Can change your personal information:</p>
<p>      • By logging in  to your account</p>

<p>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</p>
<p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party  behavioral tracking</p>
<p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from  children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,  United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which  spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect  children's privacy and safety online.</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of  13 years old.</p>
<p>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins  collect PII from children under 13?</p>
<p>Fair Information Practices</p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone  of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a  significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.  Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be  implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal  information.</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we  will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<p>      • Within 7  business days</p>
<p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
<p>      • Within 7  business days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which  requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights  against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This  principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against  data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government  agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<br>
